# Fake-Product-Review-Detection

This project implements a text classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to detect and classify textual data into categories such as:

Spam vs Ham (for email classification)

Genuine vs Fake (for product reviews)

The project demonstrates the complete NLP pipeline ‚Äî from preprocessing raw text to training ML models and evaluating their performance.

üîë Features

Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Feature extraction using Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF

Model training with algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest

Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Beginner-friendly implementation showcasing real-world NLP applications

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
